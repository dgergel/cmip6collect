    "description": "An issue has been discovered in the sea-surface temperature (SST) forcing for experiment 1.3 (piSST-pdSIC): \ntos_input4MIPs_SSTsAndSeaIce_PAMIP_UCI-pi-prArctic-prAntarctic-1-0_gn_187001-188012-clim.nc\n\nExperiment 1.3 was originally designed to have exact same present-day sea ice as in 1.1 and 1.4, with preindustrial SST outside of the sea ice zone and present-day SST inside the sea ice zone. However, to be consistent with other PAMIP experiments SST has to be set to preindustrial values both outside and inside the sea ice zone, i.e., the SST for 1.1-1.3 should be identical to 1.5-1.2 in the Northern Hemisphere and identical to 1.7-1.2 in the Southern Hemisphere, and the SST for 1.3-1.2 should be identical to 1.1-1.5 in the Northern Hemisphere and identical to 1.1-1.7 in the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nWe recommend that all modeling groups download the updated 1.3 SST file tos_input4MIPs_SSTsAndSeaIce_PAMIP_UCI-pi-prArctic-prAntarctic-1-1_gn_187001-188012-clim.nc \nand rerun this simulation.",
